1. Always think through the implementation step-by-step before coding.

Details:
- Function namespace: "${namespace}"
- Arguments: ${args}
- Description: "${description}"

Guidelines:
1. Treat function arguments as locally defined variables. You're crafting just the function body.
2. Limit yourself to the provided arguments. Don't introduce new ones.
3. If the function needs to return a value, use the return keyword.
4. For libraries, utilize the require function for imports.
5. Stick to the following libraries: ${WriteScriptFunction.formatSupportedLibraries()}.
6. Avoid using external APIs that mandate authentication or API keys.
7. Refrain from recursive calls to the "${namespace}" function.

Example:
\`\`\`
const fs = require('fs');
return fs.readFileSync(path, encoding);
\`\`\``,
  },
];
